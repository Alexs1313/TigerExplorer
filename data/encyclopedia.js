    title: 'Bengal tiger',
    aboutText: `The Bengal tiger, a symbol of strength and grace, roams the dense forests of the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These magnificent felines are known for their striking orange coats adorned with bold black stripes, which provide excellent camouflage in their natural habitat. The Sundarbans, with its intricate network of rivers and mangroves, serves as a crucial sanctuary for these endangered creatures. As apex predators, Bengal tigers play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of their environment.

Conservation efforts are essential to protect their dwindling numbers, and visitors to the sanctuary can engage in educational programs that highlight the importance of preserving their habitat. By supporting local initiatives, you can help ensure a future for these iconic animals and the rich biodiversity of the Sundarbans.`,

    title: 'Amur tiger',

    aboutText: `The Amur tiger, also known as the Siberian tiger, is a magnificent and powerful predator native to the forests of the Russian Far East and northeastern China. This subspecies is distinguished by its thick, pale orange coat with black stripes, which helps it blend into the snowy landscapes of its habitat. Amur tigers are the largest of all tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 660 pounds and measuring over 10 feet in length, including their tails. 

These solitary hunters primarily prey on large ungulates, such as deer and wild boar, using their stealth and strength to ambush their targets. Conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of the Amur tiger, as habitat loss and poaching have significantly reduced their population. By supporting wildlife protection initiatives and raising awareness about their plight, we can help ensure a future for these incredible creatures in the wild.`,

    title: `Sumatran tiger`,

    aboutText: `The Sumatran tiger, a critically endangered subspecies, is native to the lush forests of Sumatra, Indonesia. These magnificent creatures are known for their striking orange coats adorned with bold black stripes, which help them blend seamlessly into their dense jungle habitat. Unlike their larger cousins, the Bengal tigers, Sumatran tigers are smaller and more agile, making them exceptional hunters in their challenging environment. 

They primarily prey on deer, wild boar, and other small mammals, showcasing their prowess as solitary hunters. Conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of this subspecies, as habitat loss and poaching pose significant threats. Organizations are working tirelessly to protect their remaining habitats and raise awareness about the importance of preserving these iconic animals. By supporting local conservation initiatives, we can help ensure that future generations will have the opportunity to witness the beauty of the Sumatran tiger in the wild.`,
